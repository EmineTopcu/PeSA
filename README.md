# PeSA

**Pe**ptide **S**pecificity **A**nalysis

PeSA is an open source software designed as a tool to use in the analysis of peptide arrays, permutation arrays and OPALs.

Analysis can be used to generate motifs to share the results as a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM).

## Installation

PeSA consists of a single executable that can be downloaded from the Releases section on the right. The windows executable file can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/EmineTopcu/PeSA/releases/tag/v2.0) section on the right side of this window. Depending on the operating system the software will run on, PeSA.Windows.32-bit.exe or PeSA.Windows.32-bit.exe needs to be downloaded. As the software is not officially certified, some systems may give security warnings, which need to be ignored or overridden for a successful download.

## Running an Analysis

PeSA offers multiple analysis types, including motif generation, validation and prediction, which are explained below.
